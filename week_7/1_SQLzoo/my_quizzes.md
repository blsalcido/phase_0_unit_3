### Reflection

These statements are really strange and foreign at first but, I found myself warming up to SQL in no time and seem to really like it so far. I dislike SQLZoo in so far as it wouldn't let me create an account until I finished all of the quizzes which was really annoying and now it's not showing a) all of my results b) accurate results. I don't know what's wrong but, I'm just going to move on to the other challenges. I feel really good about this so, I'm not worried about it just so long as I feel I've learned something. Might be fun to pair on this but, I hope SQLZoo isn't the new dreaded Stypi.
