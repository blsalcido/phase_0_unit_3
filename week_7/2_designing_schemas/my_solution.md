## Release 5: Reflection
<!-- 
Still getting familiar with keys. I think that was the weirdest part of this challenge for me. 
I attempted to connect various fields to one another but, could never make it work without 
assigning a foreign key. Otherwise, this was rather simple. I hope I got the markdown right 
for displaying these images!!!  -->
