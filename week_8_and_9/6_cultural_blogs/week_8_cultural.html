      <h2>Considerations On DBC's Environment</h2>
    
      <p>
        I like that DBC takes an "in-this-together" approach to creating a learning environment becasue it reminds me that I am not competing with my classmates but, rather, am a part of DBC just like they are and we all stand to gain from helping one another.

        I believe that I'll thrive under conditions in which it is encouraged for each student to share their knowledge as opposed to hoarding for themselves.

        I feel very "zen" lately. I don't really want to spend much more time making predictions about how I will feel once I get to DBC. I'd rather just internalize the calm I feel at the moment and bring it with me on day 1. This way, I'm not setting myself up for over-thinking things and becoming worried all over again. I'm looking forward to learning new things and being challenged every day. I expect it to be an intense experience and I expect to be a sorce of support for those arround me. Beyond that, I expect nothing.
