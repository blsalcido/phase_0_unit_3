This exercise was really fun. I still really like SQL. It just seems to make sense to me. 
It's funny because there are still somethings about Ruby that puzzle me quite a bit but, 
I feel like I understand databases really well. Maybe this will change/maybe I'm wrong, lol. But, it does "seem" that way, at least. 

I worked on this with a partner and she's fantastic. Whenever we pair, I feel like the challenge is really just a project we're both working on for fun and that makes the whole experience feel light and fluffy as opposed to daunting and dreary. 

We got stuck on how to create foreign keys to connect our tables. We were uncertain whether or not the instructions meant for us to use JOIN or if they meant for use to use ALTER or to create Foreign Key when we created our table. We tried a number of ways but always got a syntax error. We posted to the google community page asking for help and have not received any feedback yet. To be continued...

I feel very happy with how this challenge went and am very excited about it in general, it was lots of fun for me!
